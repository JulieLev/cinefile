### Team Cinefile

### What We've Already Done
 - Decided on User Stories
 - MVPs
 - Waffle link to Github repo
 - MVC structure established
 - Associations
 - User, Cinefile, List Film & Film Models
 - The beginnings of an interface
 - Researched and played around with tmdb API
 - Implemented bootstrap (inc. navbar).

### Struggles
 - API / some form of comprehensive data capture for release dates / screening times
 - New technology
 - Trying to do too much in one go

### Plan of Attack
 - Add list_film to Cinefile
 - Creation of film objects (saving to db)
 - Implement tmdb API film search (& extracting user choice)
 - Display all Cinefile films nicely
 - Work out notifications
